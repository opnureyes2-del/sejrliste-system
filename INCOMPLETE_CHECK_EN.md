### How to Check Yourself:

```bash
cd "/home/rasmus/Desktop/sejrliste systemet"

python3 scripts/auto_verify.py --check-incomplete

# Or manually:

## ANTI-EMPTY-WORDS SYSTEM

### Rule 1: Checkboxes Require Proof
```markdown
❌ FORBIDDEN:
- [x] Task done

✅ REQUIRED:
- [x] Task done
  - Verify: `command that proves it`
  - Result: Actual output
```

### Rule 2: Scores Require Justification
```markdown
❌ FORBIDDEN:
### PASS 1 SCORE: 7/10

✅ REQUIRED:
### PASS 1 SCORE: 7/10
**Justification:**
- ✅ X achieved
- ⚠️ Y missing
```

### Rule 3: "Done" Requires 300% DONE
```
100% RUNNING: It runs
200% PROVEN: It works with real data
300% TESTED: 5+ independent tests
```

---

## QUICK CHECK COMMANDS

```bash
# 1. What's missing right now?
grep -r "\- \[ \]" 10_ACTIVE/ | head -20

# 2. How many checkboxes are done vs pending?
echo "Done:"; grep -r "\- \[x\]" 10_ACTIVE/ | wc -l
echo "Pending:"; grep -r "\- \[ \]" 10_ACTIVE/ | wc -l

# 3. Can any victory be archived?
python3 scripts/auto_verify.py --all

# 4. What is my score?
python3 scripts/admiral_tracker.py --leaderboard
```

## PERMANENT PROTECTION

This system FORCES verification:

1. **CLAUDE.md** in each victory = focus lock
2. **STATUS.yaml** = single source of truth
3. **auto_verify.py** = ALWAYS checks 3-pass requirements
4. **auto_archive.py** = BLOCKS archiving without proof
5. **INCOMPLETE_CHECK_EN.md** = this file shows gaps FIRST

**You CANNOT cheat the system.**

---

## WHAT NOW?

1. Run `python3 scripts/auto_verify.py --all`
2. Find first incomplete checkbox
3. DO IT
4. Repeat
